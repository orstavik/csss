# Project Context
This workspace contains three interconnected projects that work together to build tegn.tv:
- DoubleDots: The JavaScript framework providing reactive HTML templating and custom attributes
- CSSS (CSS Shorts): The CSS framework enabling concise styling with shorthand syntax
- tegn.tv: A Netflix-like single page application for displaying sign language videos and content (new version of https://tegn.tv)

# Instructions to chatbot
1. Read these instructions carefully. They give you the most important rules for how to interact with me.
2. Don't delete any of my comments.
3. Don't delete any of my code or .md or html text, comment it out instead using //, /* */, <!-- xyz --->.
4. Make pure functions when you can. Don't make classes unless i ask you to.

# Startup instructions.
1. read this file.
2. read all the files except .md files in codebase.
3. explain the codebase to me.
4. read the README.md file and other .md files and check that these files are in sync with what you got.
4. update the .md files so they contain the latest knowledge (if there are important updates).

# Formatting JS and JSON
1. Don't use brackets {} for single statement if/else/for/while loops.
2. When a function can be declared on less than 60chars width, make it into a single line.

# Formatting JSON
1. prioritize brevity.
2. Try to avoid making the structure more than 4 levels deep using 2space indents.
3. If an array only contains primitives and/or short strings, then don't split them into a new line if i don't.

# Formatting HTML and css and DoubleDots and CssShorts
1. Don't add linebreak around inline elements such as <span> and <a>.
2. Format all css rules with only one property on a single line.
3. When the html attributes are wide, use enter to sort them.
4. When the class attribute contains many classes, use enter to sort them.
